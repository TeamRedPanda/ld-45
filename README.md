## What went right
We finished a playable game :D 

Animations and model weren't bad.

## What went wrong
Animation cancel makes it awkward to play with sword, so the player can't spawn attacks with it. 

Animation lock takes too long and it gets frustating to the player. 

No feedback or sound effects for hits on enemies or hit takens. 

Enemies AI was rushed and end up not working properly.

## What we would change
Change weapon select at end of the round for a drop system to test which works best.

## What we would improve
Character model. 

Create different enemies model. 

Make more suitable animations for the game. 

Change to a more diverse map.
