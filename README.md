## What went right
We finished a playable game :D 

Animations and model weren't bad.

## What went wrong
Animation cancel makes it awkward to play with sword, so the player can't spam attacks with it. 

Animation lock takes too long and it gets frustating to the player. 

No feedback or sound effects for hits on enemies or hit taken. 

Enemy AI was rushed and end up not presenting fun scenarios for the player.

## What we would change
Change weapon select at end of the round for a drop system to test which works best. 

(gg) Dropping from each defeated enemy makes the game have a more gladiator feel to it. You get the weapon of you enemy.

## What we would improve
Character model. 

Create different enemy models. 

Make more suitable animations for the game. 

(gg) Current animations are akin to dark souls-esque combat, we need faster animations like link to the past and link's awakening.

Change to a more diverse map.
